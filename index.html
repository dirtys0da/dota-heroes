            <td>Xin, the Ember Spirit, is a highly mobile and versatile melee agility hero whose abilities
               make him a slippery foe who can dance around his enemies at will. His skill set allows
               for aggressive assaults on other heroes, as he can engage on them from long range
               using Sleight of Fist and tie them down with Searing Chains. His Flame Guard ability
               deals damage in a small area around him while shielding him from magic nukes, making
               him a force to be reckoned with by enemy casters. Finally, his Fire Remnant spell
               enables him to engage, escape, or move instantaneously around the map, allowing him
               to appear where the enemy least expects and disappear just as quickly.

               He is unique in that he possesses a total of 14 abilities in his arsenal; three of
               them - Quas, Wex, and Exort - are reagents and one is his special ultimate Invoke.

            <td>Skitskurr, the Weaver, is a ranged agility hero, renowned for being one of the hardest
               heroes in the game to properly lock down and kill, despite his extreme fragility.
               This is mainly due to his low-cooldown Shukuchi ability, which provides him both max
               movement speed and invisibility when used, making him highly effective at chasing
               enemies as well as escaping from battle.
